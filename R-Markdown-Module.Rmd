# What is R Markdown?

## An Authoring and Analysis Framework

- Save and execute code

- Generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience

- Why?

  - Turn work created in R into more accessible formats
  
  - Incorporate R code and R plots into the same documetns
  
  - They are reproducible. If you change the data, everything in the document automatically changes. 

  - (Hint: This is a huge benefit!)


## You Don't Want to Turn in This:




## Or Even This:


## But You Could Turn in This:



## With R Code, Results, Figures Embedded in a Nice Doc:




## Let's take a closer look at the final output of the document produced in R Markdown

See .pdf of the Data Visualization lecture notes




## This is a R Markdown Presentation about R Markdown

In my kids' high school classes, they all learned *Google Slides*. In fact, they learn everything in the *Google Suite*.

Google/MS PPT convenient, but they're highly limited

This presentation is created in R Markdown. It handles technical material better than most other software

The title slide of the R Markdown file:




## A Broader Comment on Producing Nice Documents

- First, you can produce nice documents in many different programs

- You don't have to adopt RMarkdown for everything

- With that said, different programs are better suited than others for various tasks

- Let's think about some common options:

  - Word, Google Docs, Pages, ODT, RTF, LaTeX
  
  - What is beautiful about RMarkdown is that it will output into most of other types
  
  - So you can do your math, code, tables, figures, etc in a program designed for this, and then output into other forms



## Flexibility. Output documents

## Version Control

When using the notebook, can implement version control

R Markdown files are plain-text files, so they work well with version control

In the second part of Module 5, we will be covering version control using Github in much more detail

```{r, include=FALSE}
#https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html
```

## Shiny Apps

We'll discuss `Shiny Apps` later in the semester. For now, just have a look at this one that our IPD program manager created:

[[See Link Here]](https://ethan-tenison.shinyapps.io/Pionero_Nonprofit_Explorer/)


## Quiz: 

Which of the following end outputs can RMarkdown **not** write to:

- .pdf
- .html
- .edu
- .doc(x)


## Answer: 

```{r, include=FALSE}
# freebie here: the answer is .edu
```



# How Does it Work?

  
## Working in R Markdown

R Markdown comes with a very nice template

Click on the add document button in the upper left of RStudio, and choose R Markdown 

Or: File > New File > R Markdown; Click presentation tab (or another); Enter other meta information



**And note that R Markdown defaults the working directory to the location of the .Rmd file**


## Notebook Interface

Flexible framewok in which you can run the whole document, or in chunks

There is a back end, markup side, and then a final output

Render output at any point to see what the final product looks like

```{r}

3 + 4

x <- sqrt(144)

x

```




## Types of Data Inputted into R Markdown

- Meta data
- Text
- Code chunks


## Working with Information Types: Meta-data

- If Meta-Data:
  - YAML: Originally YAML was said to mean *Yet Another Markup Language*
  - *YAML Ain't Markup Language*
  - Go to the meta data and talk through it
    - `beamer_presentation`
    - `html_document`
    - many other possibilities. see above

- Headings
  - Technically not meta-data, but let's look at how file organization works
  
  - Try adding section, subsection, and subsubsection headings
  
  - Code this and then `Knit` the document
  

  
## Working with Information Types: Text

- If text: largely what you would do otherwise. 

- But some unique ways of inputting types of text
  
  - Plain text, as is
  - Bold: **bold**
  - Italics: *italics*
  - [links](markdown.rstudio.com)
  - `code`
  - Bullets and sub-bullets

- Note that bullets occur by adding a dash with a space
  - And sub-bullets by indent, dash, space
  
1. Numbered lists by just putting in the numbers
2. Like this

  
- See cheatsheet!!! [[Link here]](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)
  - Especially the section called "Pandoc's Markdown"




## Working with Information: Code Chunks. The basic setup

- Use 3 single right quotation marks to begin and end. Everything in between is run by R, and should be coded as such






## Working with Information: Code Chunks. (Continued)

- Note that it typically produces weird output with comments. Let's get rid of those

```{r}
2 + 2 
```

We can get rid of the pound sign by adding the comment: ````{r, comment=""}`

```{r, comment = ""}
2 + 2 
```

Notice the difference?


## What if I Want to See the Code I Used to Produce Some Output

- Use the `echo` option

```{r, comment = "", echo=TRUE}
2 + 2 
```



## Working with Information: Code Chunks

- `include = TRUE/FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
- `echo = TRUE/FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
- `message = TRUE/FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
- `warning = TRUE/FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
- `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphical results.
- See cheatsheet for many more options


## Quiz: 

If you want to make a comment to yourself, but not have it appear in the final output, would you include?

- `include=NEITHER`
- `include=FALSE`
- `include=TRUE`
- `include=NONE`


## Answer: 

```{r, include=FALSE}
# It would be `include=FALSE`
```



# Some Examples and Concluding Thoughts

## Let's look at the Data Visualization Module .Rmd file

- Open the *Data Visualization R Markdown* file

- Work through some of the components of that

- The preamble can be quite complicated. But it doesn't have to be

- Notice the preamble, text options, and the R code chunks

- Everything fits into these three types of information



## Make your own file with the three types of information

Please take some time to play around with some various options

See the cheatsheet for ideas

Open, add metadata, add text, add r code chunks, `knit` and save the document 

Let's do one together


## First add the preamble, note that R will generate it for you, but...

```{r}
#---
#title: "R-Markdown-Practice-File"
#author: "Findley"
#date: "6/9/2020"
#output: html_document
#---
```

## Markup vs. the Final Output

- For a minute ignore everything down below the preamble. It's helpful example code, but back to that shortly

- Here you will use the `Knit` command to produce the output of interest




## Try changing the output type:

- `pdf_document`
- `html_document`
- `word_document`
- etc

Notice that you might need some additional material installed!!

If you do a .pdf document, you'll need to have a version of LaTeX



## Installling LaTeX

There are multiple full LaTeX installations if you want to use LaTeX. 

Or you can install *tinytex*. Here's how:

```{r}
#install.packages('tinytex')
#tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

This can be a bit of a pain, but note that it's not much different than having to purchase and ensure that MS Word is on your machine.

You're just getting a different typesetting platform with LaTeX. If you choose `word_document` for your output, you need Word installed. 



## Let's add a table of contents

`toc: true`



## Notice that when you start a R Markdown file, that it gives you a default

- You may or may not want that:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

- If you want to, you can of course delete this and set all your own code how you wish

- Or keep it and change `echo = TRUE` so that it changes the default

- What does this mean in practice?


## Much of the time, don't want the code!

Let's use the *cars* data to illustrate this. The following shows the code we're using:

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Weight", ylab = "MPG")
```


## Can also use the preamble code for  a variety of purposes

- Drop code (`echo=FALSE`), align figures, and add a caption

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='MY AMAZING figure'}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Weight", ylab = "MPG")
```


## Let's try some of our other functionality discussed above
  
  - Plain text, as is
  - Bold: **bold**
  - Italics: *italics*
  - [links](markdown.rstudio.com)
  - `code`

- Bullets and sub-bullets
  - Note that bullets occur by adding a dash with a space
    - And sub-bullets by indent, dash, space
  
1. Numbered lists by just putting in the numbers
2. Like this

## There can be some frustrating things, but just need to work through them a bit

For example:

Notice what happens when we do bullets these two ways:

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2

And now

-Bullet 3
-Bullet 4

What happened?


## The text options are pretty straightforward, but do require some getting used to

Superscript: `superscript^2`
Subscript: `subscript~2~`
Strikethrough: `~~strikethrough~~`


## Headers

Header 1: `# Header 1`
Header 2: `## Header 2`
Header 3: `### Header 3`
Header 4: `#### Header 4`
Header 5: `##### Header 5`
Header 6: `###### Header 6`





## Can make simple, elegant tables

```{r echo = TRUE, results='asis'}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], summary=FALSE)

```

## We taught you `stargazer` in the Introduction to R Module

But recall that anyone can create packages for R. And there are a lot!! Here's another package for tables:


```{r echo = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "A knitr kable.")

```

## Can also add some manual tables, which are a bit trickier

For example:

|       |Operator | Example|
|:------|:-----|:----- |
| Addition    | `+`   | `2+4` |
| Subtraction |`-`    | `2-4` |
| Multiplication | `*`  | `2*4` |
| Division | `/` | `4/2` |
| Exponentiation| `^` |`2^4` |
| Square Root | `sqrt()` | `sqrt(144)`|
| Absolute Value | `abs()` | `abs(-4)` |



## Can add some useful figures:

Recall our Napoleon figure from the Data Viz Module?




## Can add the figure a different way 




## Or some good photos:






## Might want to add a footnote

In this module,[^1] we are discussing R Markdown. 

[^1]: R Markdown is quite functional.

In our next module, we'll turn to Github






## Coding Languages

`knitr` can execute code in many langauges besides R, including:

- Python
- SQL
- Bash
- Rcpp
- Stan
- JavaScript
- CSS



## Some Complications

Recall the gapminder animation....

It worked well in .html, but not in .pdf

Need to be cognizant that it is, indeed, highly flexible, but there are some dependencies

Examples:

- html code doesn't always work well with *LaTeX*

- *LaTeX* doesn't always work well with html


## Frustrations

R Markdown can feel frustrating at first, but we encourage you to think of the alternative. 

Findley, for one, can't format a figure in MS Word to save his life

R Markdown has it's idiosyncracies, but integrates data in amazing ways. Well worth the investment of a bit of time to learn!!
